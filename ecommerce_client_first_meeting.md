## About StyleVision

StyleVision is a remarkable success story in e-commerce. In just 5 years, we've disrupted the online fashion industry through superior curation and customer service. Our traditional business fundamentals are strong - we're profitable, growing rapidly, and loved by customers. 

**However, we've barely scratched the surface with AI.** While our competitors chase every tech trend, we've focused on building a solid foundation. Now, with significant capital and the right partner, we're ready to leapfrog the competition through strategic AI implementation.

### Our Success Metrics
- **Growth Trajectory:** 200% YoY for 3 consecutive years
- **Monthly Active Users:** 2.5M (growing 15% monthly)
- **Product Catalog:** 14,200+ carefully curated SKUs
- **Customer Reviews:** 28,000+ authentic reviews (4.2 avg rating)
- **Revenue:** $125M annual run rate (2025)
- **Profitability:** EBITDA positive since Year 2
- **Customer NPS:** 72 (industry average: 45)
- **AI Investment to Date:** <$50K (massive opportunity)

## Untapped AI Opportunities

**We're successful without AI. Imagine what we could achieve with it.**

### 1. **Personalization at Scale**
Our 2.8% conversion rate is achieved through manual curation alone. Competitors using AI report 4-6% conversion rates. With our superior product selection and AI personalization, we could hit 7-8%.

### 2. **Review Intelligence**
- 15% of our reviews may be fraudulent or incentivized
- Customer sentiment analysis is manual and time-consuming
- Missing insights from unstructured review text

### 3. **Visual Search & Discovery**
Customers frequently abandon searches when they can't describe what they're looking for. Visual similarity search could capture this lost revenue.

### 4. **Inventory Optimization**
- 23% of popular items go out of stock during peak demand
- 31% of inventory sits unsold beyond 90 days
- Return rates vary wildly by product category (8-45%)

- Comprehensive documentation and testing

**Remember: You're competing against 3 other firms. We'll evaluate based on:**
1. Technical innovation and model performance
2. Business impact and ROI projections
3. Implementation speed and deployment quality
4. Team expertise and collaboration
5. Scalability of proposed solutions

   - Detect and address outliers
   - Validate data relationships

2. **Customer Segmentation**
   - Identify distinct customer personas
   - Understand purchasing patterns
   - Age and preference correlations

### Phase 2: Core AI Models (Weeks 2-3)

#### **Required Models (You must build all 3):**

1. **Recommendation Engine**
   - Collaborative filtering OR content-based filtering
   - Must handle cold-start problem
   - **Minimum Benchmark:** >60% precision@10
   - **Stretch Goal:** >75% precision@10

#### **Your 4th Model - The Innovation Opportunity:**

**This is where you differentiate yourselves from other consulting firms.**

Based on your data exploration, identify our biggest untapped opportunity. Previous consultants have surprised us with models we didn't even know we needed - fraud detection systems that caught review farms, size recommenders that reduced returns by 30%, trend predictors that identified the next big fashion movement weeks early.

**What patterns do you see in our data that we're missing?**

Your 4th model should:
- Address a real business pain point you discover
- Leverage unique insights from the data
- Demonstrate creativity and business acumen
- Be something you're excited to build

**We're not telling you what to build because we want to see what you discover.** The best consultants don't just fulfill requirements - they find opportunities we didn't know existed.

### Phase 3: Integration & Deployment (Throughout, Complete by Week 4)
- Build web application integrating all 4 models
- Deploy to cloud platform (accessible via URL)
- User-friendly interface for all stakeholders
- Basic authentication and security
- Documentation and user guide

## Common Pitfalls (Learn from Previous Teams)

- Couldn't deploy their solution successfully

**We'll provide:**
- Answers to your technical and business questions
- Clarification on priorities if you're unsure
